        Thank you for reading my novels. You are very kind. Here is a little background on my writing.

In the fall of 2017, I kept getting these four-hour windows where I had nothing to do during the week. Being a stay-at-home dad, this was a new and incredible luxury that sprang out of nowhere as my children progressed to high school, so I decided to go for it.

That fall, I wrote Disappearing like the Wind. The book took less than three months to write because it was already done in my head. I had come up with the idea over fifteen years before, so I had thought about it and completed it in my mind years ago. I enjoyed finally having it out of my head and finally on paper. I’m also proud that I wrote the book without my wife and kids knowing, so it didn’t hurt or affect their lives in any way. They were completely surprised when I showed it to them.

I had two other manuscripts that I had written back in the mid-1990s, The Valhalla Plot and Meet Your Maker. I spent some time editing and updating them for the year 2018, then decided this January to publish all three novels. I was to become fifty years old in August, so I made it my goal to get them in bookstores before I turned a half-century. Luckily, I got it done.

I hope you’ve enjoyed the novels and they have entertained for a while. I have set a goal to have a new book in 2019, but it will be tough. The family is really busy right now, and they come first. Hopefully, I’ll catch some four-hour windows soon!

I always love to hear feedback. <a href="mailto:feedback@bobkillinger.com"><br>CLICK HERE</a> to email me with your questions or whatever.
<br>
Thank you again for reading my books.

Take care and God bless,

Bob-o
