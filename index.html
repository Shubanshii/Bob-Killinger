                  Three gruesome murders in six months, all connected but no leads and the
                  Houston Police Department is under public pressure to find the serial killer.
                  The mystery breaks when an anonymous caller reports a possible burglary and the police
                  accidentally stumble on one of their officers at the scene, Detective Frank Kirkland,
                  smoking gun in his hand, covered in blood and a dead body on the staircase.
                  They found their killer. The Houston DA, realizing it's an election year,
                  takes the case against the detective, and gets his best man, David Springer,
                  to find evidence and strengthen their case. But the well known, and publicly despised,
                  female defense attorney, Trisha Thomas,
                  comes to Detective Kirkland's rescue and tries to save him from prosecution.
                  At the arraignment and bail hearing, she fights for her client's life,
                  though not sure herself of his guilt or innocence.
                  Then, with the help of David Springer,
                  Trisha finds out the shocking truth about her client's past...

        <p class="text-center">
        Thank you for reading my novels. You are very kind. Here is a little background on my writing.

In the fall of 2017, I kept getting these four-hour windows where I had nothing to do during the week. Being a stay-at-home dad, this was a new and incredible luxury that sprang out of nowhere as my children progressed to high school, so I decided to go for it.

That fall, I wrote Disappearing like the Wind. The book took less than three months to write because it was already done in my head. I had come up with the idea over fifteen years before, so I had thought about it and completed it in my mind years ago. I enjoyed finally having it out of my head and finally on paper. I’m also proud that I wrote the book without my wife and kids knowing, so it didn’t hurt or affect their lives in any way. They were completely surprised when I showed it to them.

I had two other manuscripts that I had written back in the mid-1990s, The Valhalla Plot and Meet Your Maker. I spent some time editing and updating them for the year 2018, then decided this January to publish all three novels. I was to become fifty years old in August, so I made it my goal to get them in bookstores before I turned a half-century. Luckily, I got it done.

I hope you’ve enjoyed the novels and they have entertained for a while. I have set a goal to have a new book in 2019, but it will be tough. The family is really busy right now, and they come first. Hopefully, I’ll catch some four-hour windows soon!

I always love to hear feedback. <a href="mailto:bob.killinger@yahoo.com"><br>CLICK HERE</a> to email me with your questions or whatever.
<br>
Thank you again for reading my books.

Take care and God bless,

Bob-o
