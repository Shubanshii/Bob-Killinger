            Houston Police Department is under public pressure to find the serial killer.
            The mystery breaks when an anonymous caller reports a possible burglary and the police accidentally stumble on one of their officers at the scene, Detective Frank Kirkland, smoking gun in his hand, covered in blood and a dead body on the staircase. They found their killer. The Houston DA, realizing it's an election year, takes the case against the detective, and gets his best man, David Springer, to find evidence and strengthen their case. But the well known, and publicly despised, female defense attorney, Trisha Thomas,
